# AU-Hey-Day

Auburn University started the cherished tradtion of Hey Day back in 1947 after AU students who served in WWII were largely ignored by the public, their peers, and the university. The AU student body and government started "Hey Day" as a way to promote a positive and friendly campus and encouraged students, facualty, and vistors to greet one another and form a healthier campus culture.
